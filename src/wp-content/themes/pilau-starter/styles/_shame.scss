Using display:none with aria-hidden clashes with Google maps. Apparently
aria-hidden should use visibility:hidden, though this doesn't tally with
the way aria-hidden is being used here for tabbing interfaces. Until there's
time to investigate and resolve, there's a hack here for reverting Google
maps styles appropriately.
