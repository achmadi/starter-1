Pilau Starter theme
=======

This is a starter theme for creating custom WordPress sites. It also includes other files for a default WordPress installation.

It cannot be used "out of the box"! There are barely any styles, and many things need to be initialized. [Pilau](http://pilaubase.com/) is a suite of tools for creating custom WordPress sites created by developers working with the agency [Public Life](http://www.publiclife.co.uk/), is heavily focused on client work there, and is designed as a bare-bones starting point for our projects.

However, we're very happy if anyone finds our work of use! If you feel like contributing, even better.
